                        Can this ever get better, will this ever get better. Will I ever have true joy from deep within from a figure way above me? One, two, three, no, minus one or so I think are the number of friends I have grown fond of. I am the hardest for everyone outside, I am actually very gullible, and like a child I easily get sick from bacteria I cry hard and heavy then I make sure I am the only one who battles it with God. See I know I don’t know God personally as I should but I am really trying. I am fighting demons of masturbation within every night I am all alone in my chamber, but nobody sees that until I open my mouth. My mouth dares to open to one person far away from me. Because I know he won’t judge me for what I am or what I go through. How many has it been so far and how many have I had to loose over the year in a single academic year. They come in the quantum that they leave.

                        I really wanted to come home and see happiness everywhere everyday hoping I would live with a mentality that    even in a moment of sadness I would perceive it as a normal way of life.
                        Please! Can someone hear me apart from God who listens to my heart and still requires me to pray to him before he shows me he cares...? 
                        I have fallen and apart from the world. She looked like she cared about all that I had been saying to her, she said she would follow up but she never does.
                        I will not go back in time. She said no man likes that in a woman. No man loves a woman who will bring old arguments to be argued again
